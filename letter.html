      <p class="h1">Dear</p>
      <p>I have pledged to vote in every election, because</p>
      <p>I’d like to ask you to do the same.</p>
      <p class="em">Will you commit to be a voter and cast your ballot in the mid-term election on Tuesday, November 6, 2018?</p>
      <p>I’m not asking you to vote for any particular candidate, only to be a voter.</p>
      <p>I’d like to know if you received this and plan to vote. You can visit {{url}} to commit to being a voter. And then, on November 6, cast your ballot and make your voice heard!</p>
      <p id="closing">Thank you,</p>
