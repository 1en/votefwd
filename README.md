# Welcome to Vote Forward 

The non-partisan Vote Forward project seeks to revitalize American democracy by dramatically boosting voter turnout.

We provide the tools for individual citizens to mail one another heartfelt hand-written letters that encourage voting.

If you're interested in helping by sending your own letters, or if you just want
to stay informed, please sign up for the mailing list at http://votefwd.org.

If you want to help with the software, read on.
